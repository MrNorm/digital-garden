          So we get this one near Daleton, right? And we are way too close. And Jo&lsquo;s got the vid on it right, she&lsquo;s filming it.
          And all of the sudden outta nowhere, this shitty lookin&lsquo; green Valiant comes pulling up right in the way.
          He&lsquo;s naked! Naked. Ok, so Jo&lsquo;s yelling at him to get out of the way, right? And he just strolls up to the twister,
          says &lsquo;have a drink&lsquo;, and he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it NEVER hits the ground.
